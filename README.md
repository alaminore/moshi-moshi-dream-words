Hello! Thank you for checking out Moshi Moshi Cats - Dream Words!
The Moshi Moshi Cats studied hard for their English exam. The night before the exam, they're dreaming of English and need your help remembering words!
This game was made as a final project for my Javascript class.
In order to play, the files must be loaded through a server, as they pull data from a .JSON library. You can download a server here: https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/.
Upload the files into the htdocs/ folder of your server, then navigate to localhost in your browser to view the files.
Enjoy helping the Moshi Moshi cats ace their exam. =^.^=
